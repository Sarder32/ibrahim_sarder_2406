There are various type of software testing and other testing are involved in a project, here some of them are describe:

a.	Black box testing – Internal system design is not considered in this type of testing.

b.	White box testing – This testing is based on knowledge of the internal logic of an application’s code. 

c.	Unit testing – Testing of individual software components or modules.

d.	Integration testing – Testing of integrated modules to verify combined functionality after integration

e.	Functional testing – This type of testing ignores the internal parts and focus on the output is as per requirement or not.

f.	System testing – Entire system is tested as per the requirements. 

g.	Regression testing – Testing the application as a whole for the modification in any module or functionality

h.	End-to-end testing – Similar to system testing, involves testing of a complete application environment in a situation that mimics real-world use, 

i.	Acceptance testing -Normally this type of testing is done to verify if system meets the customer specified requirements. 

j.	Load testing – It's a performance testing to check system behavior under load.
