 * Today people order their products and they have to wait for at list three day to get in in free delivary. 
 * People have a proiblem to order their products in different store for different goods.
 * People could not get their daily needs from any deli by ordering online
 * people need to go different website to order their different  prodicts 
 * Transection problem or limitation (minimum price and location) is a big problem for online ordering.
 
 20.  Here provides  a system improvement objective that would be accomplished and that would be measurable in some objective    way for each problem.
 * Our delivery system will be locally , thats why customer can get their products withen an hour.
 * Our website would have mostly local store's inventory and others big store's data collection , So 
   customer can get all products in one place.
 * We provide all daily needs from Deli store in our data base, So, you no need to go deli any more.
 * Our system combined verious website and put together in one system , it would upgrade every two weeks.
