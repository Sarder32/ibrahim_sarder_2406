2.  Location: This is the NYC based company. It has 10 locations;
    Four in Manhattan (Washington heights,
    One at Upper Harlem & south part of Bronx) ,
    One in North part of Bronx,
    Two in Queens (long Island city & Flushing),
    Two in Brooklyn (Williamsburg & Dumbo) .

3.  Employees: There are 40 employees in total (just initially). 

4.  There are 15 people are in management and 25 people are in the fieldwork. 
    (One CEO, Two General Manager: one production manager & one marketing manager, 
    Two Group Leader: one Technical & one Business, 
    Eight technical employees and Two marketing employees.
    There are 25 employees will work on fild to deliver the order to the customers.

 
5.   We provide delivery service from any store in NYC to our customers’ home. 
     It could be food, electronics, cloths, laundry cloths, and any kind of personal need from deli or pharmacy, 
     any kind of personal moving or need to deliver. (NB: we don’t do the passenger transportation)
     Our company open 24/7 and minimum order would be $20. Customer could order their product or needs in our Website,
     they could make a list and charge with their card in approximate amount of money with our 20% service charge.
     Then we buy the customers products or needs and delivered to them with a money receipt.

6.     If we get 100 order in each location per day and average order would be $50 then 100*50*20/100= $1000 we get from each location.
       1000*10=$10,000 will be daily and 10000*365=$3,650,000 will be annual income without expenses. If we assume 50% employees, 
       utility and rent = 20%, Transportation +IT operation+ Others=14%. Then total expences in a year is (3650000*84)/100 = $3066000.
       So, total gross revenue in a year without taxes is (3650000-3066000)= $584000 in ten locations.

7.      The transaction will be completed by three steps like Merchant bank account, 
        Processor and Issuing bank. 
        We accept almost all type of card like Master Card, VISA, Discovery, 
        and American Express.  We would open a business account in any Merchant Bank and with a transaction charge  (which is call discount rate) 
        the will maintain our money with the help of third party.
        Third party manage the money transferring relationship between Bank and Customer. 
        They will check the right network and pathway to the transaction. 
        Third party processor will charge per transection basis, which is in clouded the discount rate.
        Different type of bank and financial institution will provide the Cards to our consumer or customer.
        Association such as VISA, American Express, Master Card   will charge us an interchange fees 

8.      Initially we have only credit card transaction in our system. 
        We assume that we would have in average 1000 transactions per day in ten locations. 

9.      In our revenue estimation , we assume that we would have 100 orders per location from our customers and we have 10 locations. So, we can 
        consider that we could have 10*100= 1000 credit card transactions per day.

10.     if we consider that there are 20,000,000 people in new york city and loging page 200 bytes (name, address, phone number) + Order page 200 byte

	then 400 bytes needs per customer. if 0.008% people loged in or try to order per second then (20000000*.008)/100= 1600 people would be active in our page in a second.
	now 1600*400=640000 byte or 625KB/sec data we need . we also need some data for TCP/IP ticketing.

11.	We assume the population of nyc and approximate data consume in loging and transection . In ten location the throughput would be 10*625= 6250KB/sec or
	6.1MB/sec.



12.   Our clients would any person in the New York City. 
     They just need to sign up with their credit card and address information in our website and 
      order in online in any time in 7days and 24 hours.


13.  Our suppliers would be packaging company, car rentals and logistic company.
     They will supply us packaging staff, 
     and we might need car to delivered sometimes.
